# FIFA 19 Tournament Rules and Handling Disputes 

# Introduction

By entering Intergalactic Gaming competitions, each player acknowledges and agrees to comply with the following Rules and the Intergalactic Gaming Code of Conduct. Please note that IG reserves all rights to make any alterations to the rules at any point. 
 
We would recommend that all matches are streamed to assist with disputes, however all players will be obligated to stream all Finals matches. At the very least, players **must** provide photographic evidence of results and any disputes that may arise with regards to the fixture. 

This document will also serve to outline the process for handling each dispute players may face during our FIFA 19 competitions. In order to make our competitions as fair as possible, all final decisions will be at the discretion of IG. Please ensure you read this document along with the global competition rules found on the website (www.iggalaxy.com)

## Commitment

It is very important that if you are committing to the IG Alpha Cup, you have the time to give your full undivided attention. Players that start a match and do not complete it will be disqualified from the competition and will waiver all rewards. You are, however, able to quit if during the match your opponent is clearly breaking a rule and you have sufficient evidence to prove this (See Figure 3).

We want to make our competitions as fun as possible, non-committed players disrupt others’ playing time. With this being said, we do understand that situations arise which may mean you are unable to continue to compete in the tournament. We have accounted for this by giving players the option to forfeit a match prior to the match start time. In this case you will still receive your rewards earned from the previous round. 

## Replays

Since FIFA Online Friendlies do not allow for extra time or penalties, all draws will require a rematch; the first player to score will subsequently go through. If this does happen, players will need to make sure they take photos of each match score to ensure you can prove who has scored first.  

If players are about to reach the end of the match window, it is imperative they contact one of the IG admin team on the Discord channel who will be able to assist. Failure to rematch in the event of a draw may result in a default disqualification from the competition. 

## Connection Issues 

If a player loses connection during a match, they will lose the match and the victory would go to their opponent. This is the fairest possible way as we will not be able to distinguish between a genuine loss of connection and a player quitting the game. If the connection is lost within the first five minutes of the in game match time and it is 0-0, then the match may be replayed.  We advise all players participating in our tournaments to ensure that their internet connection is suitable for them to participate. 

## Rewards

Cash and other tangible rewards will typically be sent within five working days, with the delivery depending on the location of the beneficiary. Eligibility to withdraw IG Gold rewards requires a verified account which includes having a verified KYC application; notwithstanding, this does not compromise players’ participating in IG tournaments.

Rewards are calculated by the Round that each player exits the competition.

*Example:* If you win your first round but lose in the second, you have exited in Round 2 and therefore will be eligible for Round 2 rewards

**What happens if I am disqualified?**
In the event that you are disqualified from the competition for breaking any of the rules in this document or the global competition rules (on platform), or fail to show up for a match - you will leave the competition with no rewards. The rewards that you would have earned at that point will be sent to the Intergalactic Foundation.

**What happens if I cancel a match before it starting?**
If you cancel a match before the start time by forfeiting through the platform you will be able to claim the rewards earned up to that point.

*Example***:** If you get into Round 3 but forfeit your match prior to the start time, you have effectively exited the competition in Round 2 and will still receive the rewards from that round.

## Gameplay Settings 
- Game Type: Online Friendlies (1 v 1) 
- Difficulty Level: World Class
- Half Length = 6 Minutes
- Customised Squads: Not Permitted

It is the sole responsibility of the player to ensure the Gamertag/PSN ID they use, is correct and matches the Gamertag/PSN ID listed on their IG account. Equally, players must abstain from adding a guest to their match; this tournament is strictly 1 v 1. If a player is found to have invited another player to their match, they will be disqualified. 

## Streaming 

We advise that all players stream their matches to assist with resolving any potential disputes. Please note that all players playing in the finals will be obligated to stream their matches. This includes: 

- Quarter Finals
- Semi Finals 
- Third Place Play-Offs
- Final

IG may use content from our tournaments for promotional purposes, in the event that we do, we agree to always credit the owner of the content.

Abusive or offensive language will **NOT** be tolerated. If you are found to be guilty of this whilst streaming you will be automatically disqualified and further action may be taken against you. 


----------
# Your Conduct
## Security

Players are prohibited from sharing personal information. This includes:

- Usernames
- Passwords
- Email Addresses
- Phone Numbers 

If another person accesses your account, you may be disqualified from the competition. This includes giving out your password to allow others to account recover your Gamertag/PSN ID.

## Abusive/Offensive Behaviour

Participants will be required to uphold the highest standards and to observe common respect. Once again, comments pertaining to gender, race, or sexual orientation will **NOT** be tolerated. If you are found to be guilty of this, you will have swift action taken against you. Being abusive in any way towards fellow admins or fellow players will also result in disciplinary action.

    ## Honesty 

Recording false data, information, or statements will not be tolerated and will result in automatic disqualification. In the event of this, you will once again waiver all rights to your rewards to the Intergalactic Foundation.


----------
# Submitting Results + Disputes
## Submitting Results

Both players must enter the correct score at the end of the match. In the event that players submit a different score, a dispute will automatically be processed by our admin team who will use the evidence provided by both players to decide what the correct score is. At this point, whichever player has submitted an incorrect score will be disqualified from the competition and could face further disciplinary action in the IGGalaxy at IG’s discretion. 

In the event that both players are found to enter incorrect scores, both players will be disqualified from the competition and may be subject to further disciplinary action.
 
If a fixture is not played, and neither team reports a score, both players will be knocked out of the competition and may be subject to further disciplinary action.

## Evidence

Players are expected to submit photographic evidence of the final score as a minimum, as well as any evidence needed to file a dispute.
 
If you fail to submit sufficient evidence of rule breaking and/or the correct score, this may result in the opponent being given the benefit of the doubt following disputes risen.

## Disputes

Disputes are the process in which you can raise issues related to your opponent breaking any of the rules outlined above. There are some disputes that will automatically be triggered by the system and some that you will be required to raise yourself on the platform if they occur, these are outlined below.

**Automatic Disputes**
Our system will automatically raise a dispute if a certain event is triggered. You can see the potential outcomes of these events below.

| **Dispute**                                             | **Evidence**                                 | **Outcome**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| My opponent hasn’t selected ‘Ready' on the platform     | Not needed.                                  | In this event your opponent will automatically be disqualified from the tournament after the 15 minute starting window has ended and you will receive the default 3-0 win. In the event that both players don’t select ready, both players will be disqualified from the tournament and the opponent in the next round will be given an automatic win (3-0) |
| My opponent has recorded the wrong score.               | Photographic evidence of the correct score.  | In the event both players submit different scores, a dispute will automatically open for an admin to investigate. If your opponent won the match but submitted an incorrect score they will be disqualified. Your correct score will be verified.                                                                                                           |
| My opponent claims to have won the fixture but did not. | Photographic evidence of the correct result. | Opponent will be disqualified for providing incorrect information. Your correct score will be verified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**Manual Disputes**

**To reiterate,** **any player that is disqualified will lose their rewards to the Intergalactic Foundation.**

*Breaching competition rules may lead to disciplinary action and potential removal from participating in the IGGalaxy. This action will be at the discretion of the IG Team where our admins may be called in to present evidence; all parties will have equal opportunity to provide evidence which will be taken into account. The repercussions for rule breaches may include, but will not be limited to, forfeits, replays, penalty points, temporary suspensions and permanent bans.*
 
*You must be familiar with the current rule set. Generally speaking, rules may be open for interpretation. However, within the IGGalaxy, the only interpretation which matters, is the interpretation of the IG* *T**eam and admins.*

Intergalactic Gaming wish you the best of luck and more importantly to just have fun!
